This is the 7th Project I made to showcase the knowledge of "100 days of code" course.
This is a website made using Flask and Squalchemy. It contains a db file with exisisting records.
It shows the Cafes in Cracow with their map url, address, google rating, price range and indicates whethe ryou can order cocktails there and have lunch.
The app gives a user ability to add a Cafe as well, but in order to delete or edit a record one will need a secret password.

I'm open to any hints and suggestion for this code.
